# fine_art_asssociations_meanings

The purpose of this branch is provide the scripts required to access the APIs of the museums and galleries to get the metadata of the Vanitas paintings.  These can include technique, medium, dimension, description etc.  This information can be used to annotate the painting and relate the objects to abstract concepts.

If a museum/gallery does not have an API, code to assist with scraping the websites is provided.

## API scripts

At the moment, only Harvard's API has been accessed and has required the use of two scripts:

* harvard_get_vanitas_object_ids.py: queries the API with "Vanitas" in the title and stores the objectnumber, imagepermissionlevel, date, ID and title for each image in a single JSON file called "harvard_vanitas_results.json"

* harvard_get_vanitas_metadata.py: queries the API using the object IDs in "harvard_vanitas_results.json" and gets the metadata for each painting.  This includes technique, medium, dimension, description etc.  The metadata is then stored in a JSON file for each painting and follows the naming convention <object_id>.json.

## Web scraping scripts

There are two scripts for scraping web pages: one which uses Selenium and one which does not.

Selenium is a package which is typically used to test websites, but can also be used to access the text generated by javascript when scraping web pages.  Otherwise, only the text within the HTML code would be accessible.
